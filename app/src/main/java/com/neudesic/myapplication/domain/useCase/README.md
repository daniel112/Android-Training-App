# UseCase
> Clean Architecture is a Use Case driven architecture, hence each repository method exists only because it is supporting a Use Case.

Ref: https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/domain-layer#conventions
Use cases (Also called `Interactors`) show us the intent of the software. They describe the behavior of a system and its interactions with users. They are likely the first thing to be listed when we think about a new application.


## Naming Convention
`verb in present tense + noun/what (optional) + UseCase`
